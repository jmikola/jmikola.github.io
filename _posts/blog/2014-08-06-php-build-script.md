Before joining MongoDB to work on the [PHP driver][mongo-php-driver] a couple of
years ago, I was perfectly content the PHP binaries in my operating system's
package manager. Sure, every now and then I dipped into a [PPA][ppa] for a
custom build, but one PHP version at a time sufficed. Coming to work on an
extension meant that I'd need to juggle between various versions of PHP for
building and testing.

I did get a number of responses to that tweet, mentioning projects such as
[phpenv][] and [phpbrew][], but they were mostly geared towards PHP application
development. At the time, those projects had limitations when it came to
customizing build flags; however, I should note that [phpbrew][] has had a very
active year of development since then and likely deserves some reconsideration.
[Thierry Marianne][thierry-marianne] also shared some research he was doing to
compile multiple versions of PHP using Fabric, which he since published as
[php-compiler][].

I initially started with Derick's [blog post][derick-php] on managing multiple
PHP versions. One of the first changes I made was modifying it to use the
[git-new-workdir][] command instead of a [sparse SVN checkout][php-svn-sparse],
which is also mentioned in PHP's own [Git FAQ][php-git-multiple]. I'm pretty
sure that the current iteration of his build script differs a bit from the one
in his blog post, which actually pre-dates PHP's move from SVN to Git.

Compiling directly from Git (or SVN) had a few extra hoops, which is discussed
in the [Building PHP][building-php] chapter of the
[PHP Internals Book][internals-book]. Aside from ensuring tags and commits were
fetched locally, having to run `buildconf` was a special chore. Each version of
PHP seemed to have a slightly different (and conflicting) requirements for
[Bison][bison], which is needed by `buildconf`. Rather than dive down the rabbit
hole of writing something to juggle Bison versions, I opted to look into using
PHP's release tarballs, which conveniently do not require `buildconf` at all.

I ended up with a relatively simple script that does the following:

 * Downloads a PHP tarball for a specific version (e.g. 5.5.15)
 * Allow a label (e.g. 5.5) to be specified for naming INI and install directories
 * Adds a common set of config flags (e.g. debug mode, extensions, <abbr title="Zend Thread Safety">ZTS</abbr>)
 * Builds PHP for the given options, INI and install directories
 * Logs the build process and deletes the temporary build directory afterwards

The script follows:

{% gist f19db4e8de105ee60c06 build_php.sh %}

There are a few shortcomings. For one, Derick's build script allowed for 32-bit
builds, which I've yet to add in here. His build options are also more flexible,
being a string that gets concatenated into the `configure` command. I've limited
things to a list of `--enable` flags, which appear in a `for` loop. It shouldn't
be too hard to change either of these.

An interesting factoid I learned while creating this script is that
[POSIX shells do not support array types][sh-array]. Portability is something to
keep in mind when targetting a script for `/bin/sh`. After six years, I still
forget that Ubuntu uses [Dash][dash].

The main things to configure in the script are:

 * `base_install_dir`: Where the INI and install directories should be created.
   If you build 5.5.15 with a label of 5.5, this is where the script will create
   the `etc-5.5` and `php-5.5` directories. I use `~/bin/php-bin` by default.
 * `download_dir`: Some scratch directory for the script to use when downloading
   PHP tarballs. The script will check this directory for previously downloaded
   tarballs before invoking curl. I use `~/bin/php-cache` by default.
 * The config flags alluded to above reside in a `for` loop somewhere in the
   middle of the script. The current defaults work for me, but this will likely
   be changed to a simple string variable (as in Derick's script) later on.

Running the script should product the following:

```plaintext
$ build_php.sh 5.5.15 5.5
===> Downloading: http://php.net/get/php-5.5.15.tar.gz/from/this/mirror => /home/jmikola/bin/php-cache/php-5.5.15.tar.gz
===> Unpacking: /home/jmikola/bin/php-cache/php-5.5.15.tar.gz => /tmp/build_php-5.5.15.Wh2
===> Changed build directory to: /tmp/build_php-5.5.15.Wh2/php-5.5.15
===> Creating config file directory: /home/jmikola/bin/php-bin/etc-5.5
===> Creating config file scan directory: /home/jmikola/bin/php-bin/etc-5.5/conf.d
===> Building and installing to: /home/jmikola/bin/php-bin/php-5.5
===> Build output will be logged to: /tmp/build_php-5.5.15.log.rA2
===> Build complete; deleting temporary directory: /tmp/build_php-5.5.15.Wh2
$
```

If the script completes successfully, it will delete the temporary build
directory; however, the build log (output from `configure` and `make`) will
stick around. You can also `tail -f` the build log while the script is running.

And no script is complete without a usage example:

```plaintext
$ build_php.sh 
Usage: /home/jmikola/bin/build_php.sh version [label] [zts]
  version: Full x.y.z version (e.g. 5.5.15)
  label:   Short version for install path (e.g. 5.5); defaults to full version
  zts:     Add --enable-maintainer-zts build flag if 1; defaults to false
$
```

I should note that in the previous example, the build script created two folders
in `$base_install_dir` for storing INI and conf files: `etc-5.5` and
`etc-5.5/conf.d`. Were I to build PHP with the same label again, we wouldn't see
these messages as it'd find the existing directories and use them as-is. In
practice, I only use a single INI file for these PHP installs, but we create
both paths as PHP has build options for each of them.

My INI file looks like the following:

{% gist f19db4e8de105ee60c06 php.ini %}

Once a version (or two) of PHP is installed, we can use a small shell function
to toggle between them:

{% gist f19db4e8de105ee60c06 pe.sh %}

My typical workflow on the MongoDB driver is running `pe 5.5` immediately after
opening a terminal in my project directory. This bumps the binary directory for
"5.5" to the front of my session's `$PATH`, which means I'll use that version
when executing `phpize` or `php` for extension compilation and testing,
respectively. Jumping between versions works fine, but I haven't bothered to
add support for reverting back to my system path as I usually just open a new
shell at that point.

Managing multiple PHP versions is still a headache, but this has saved me from
throwing in the towel and using a cluster of virtual machines. Hopefully someone
else finds it useful, too.
