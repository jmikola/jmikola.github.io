**tl;dr:** Use [maxTimeMS][] instead of client-side socket timeouts.

Some time ago, a MongoDB user opened [PHP-1164][] to report that connections had
started to pile up on their server due to some long-running queries. The user
was particularly concerned because the connection count had greatly exceeded the
number of PHP workers on their app server(s).

Unlike most of our multi-threaded drivers, the single-threaded PHP driver uses
persistent connections instead of pooling. You should generally expect each
worker to keep a single connection per MongoDB endpoint (i.e. host, port, and
auth combination) and reuse that socket between requests. For instance, an
application that always connects to a three-node replica set would maintain
three sockets per worker (one to each node). When the number of connections in
[mongostat][] starts to exceed your worker pool, that warrants some investigation.

Thankfully, the user was able to attach a small script that reproduced his
problem:

```php
MongoCursor::$timeout = 100;

$mc = new MongoClient();
$coll = $mc->test->php1164;

$cursor = $coll->find([
  'profile.name'=> new MongoRegex('/^Edmunds/i'),
]);

var_dump(iterator_to_array($cursor));
```

This is pretty straightforward: we connect, execute a (hopefully) indexed query
using an anchored [regex pattern][], and finally iterate through the cursor and
dump our results. Apart from using the deprecated `MongoCursor::$timeout`
property instead of [`MongoCursor::timeout()`][cursor-timeout] or the
`socketTimeoutMS` connection option, it was fairly innocuous.

When benchmarking the script with 10 concurrent requests via [ab][], they found
active connections on the server climb to 1000+. [netstat][] reported that the
majority of sockets local to the server were lingering in the `CLOSE_WAIT`
state. From the driver's perspective, any sockets listed were reported as
`FIN_WAIT` or `TIME_WAIT`. This meant that the driver had closed *its* side of
the connection but we were still waiting for the server to acknowledge that.

The following state diagram[^1] helps put this into perspective:

!["TCP state diagram"][tcp_states]

Without access to the user's data files, I had to resort to other means of
reproducing the problem locally. I immediately thought of the [$where][]
operator, which allows us to execute arbitrary JavaScript during query
evaluation[^2]. Querying a non-empty collection with `{"$where": "sleep(1000)"}`
allows us to delay the match evaluation for each document by one second.
Combined with a 100 millisecond client-side timeout, we could simulate the
original issue and force the driver to abandon connections and queries that were
still executing on the server. The following script does just that:

```php
$mc = new MongoClient(null, ['socketTimeoutMS' => 100]);
$coll = $mc->test->php1164;

$cursor = $coll->find([
  '$where' => 'sleep(1000) || true',
]);

var_dump(iterator_to_array($cursor));
```

Before benchmarking, I tweaked my [FPM pool configuration][fpm-config] to allow
the number of web workers to scale up to 1000. I usually have a static pool of
two workers on my development machine, but we were going to need quite a bit
more than that for this test:

```
pm = dynamic
pm.max_children = 1000
pm.min_spare_servers = 5
pm.max_spare_servers = 50
pm.start_servers = 5
```

With FPM restarted and the PHP script deployed to a virtual host, I kicked off
a hundred thousand requests (500 at a time):

```plaintext
ab -r -n 100000 -c 500 http://php1164.local/
```

When running this test against MongoDB 2.6, I had mixed luck watching the server
load with [mongostat][]. Execution of the [serverStatus][] command it uses was
delayed by our blast of `$where` queries, which left gaps in the poll intervals.
For the record, MongoDB 3.0 did a much better job of reporting its stats under
heavy load. Here's a snippet of the output during our test on 2.6:

```plaintext
query command     qr|qw   ar|aw  netIn netOut  conn       time
   *0     1|0       0|0     0|0    62b     3k     1   16:08:47
   56   169|0       0|0    56|0    10k    57k    57   16:08:48
   43   121|0      10|1    91|0     7k    42k    93   16:08:52
  926  2380|0       1|1   798|0   151k   772k   799   16:09:07
 1788   658|0       0|1   216|0    99k   269k   221   16:09:11
  418     1|0       0|0     0|0    16k    18k     1   16:09:12
```

The gaps between poll intervals made it impossible to see the true query and
connection load on the server; however, tailing the server logs provided a more
accurate look at our connection load. Open connections on the server reached a
peak of 969 before the first queries finished executing and connections began to
close. Bumping the `sleep()` delay in our `$where` criteria up to 10 seconds
resulted in a peak of 2305 connections before the load began to subside.

While using [$where][] for this test was a bit contrived, it did succinctly
demonstrate the problem with client-side socket timeouts. Having the driver
abruptly close sockets for long-running operations can inadvertently cause of
<abbr title="Denial of service">DoS</abbr> attack against your database server
given a high enough request load.

 * Sockets, file descriptors, and threads are limited resources. In this test,
   we were letting connections (i.e. threads with sockets) accumulate on the
   server as it needlessly prepares a response the driver will never read!
 * Creating connections has overhead. Closing a socket on a long-running query
   prevents the driver from persisting that connection for the worker to re-use
   in a subsequent request.

Client-side timeouts certainly have their uses in allowing an application to
remain responsive despite network latency or connectivity issues, but they are
not a general tool for curtailing long-running operations. Thankfully, MongoDB
2.6 introduced the [maxTimeMS][] query and command option expressly for that
purpose.

Let's see how replacing `socketTimeoutMS` with a call to
[`MongoCursor::maxTimeMS()`][cursor-maxtimems] can eliminate the DoS side-effect
of our original script.

```php
$mc = new MongoClient;
$coll = $mc->test->php1164;

$cursor = $coll->find([
  '$where' => 'sleep(1000) || true',
]);

$cursor->maxTimeMS(100);

var_dump(iterator_to_array($cursor));
```

This script relies on the driver's default socket timeouts but trusts the server
to gracefully abort the query on its own after 100 milliseconds of *execution*
time (think CPU time vs. wall time). In contrast to our previous test, the driver
will actually read a response from the server (albeit an error message) and keep
the connection open for the next request. From the developer's perspective, the
only difference should be that a [MongoExecutionTimeoutException][] will be
thrown instead of a [MongoCursorTimeoutException][].

Running the revised script yields the following, abridged output from
[mongostat][]:

```

We can see connections slowly ramp up to about 500, which is consistent with our
concurrency level. The initial connection count of 51 is also consistent with
`pm.max_spare_servers` from our FPM configuration, as the log was captured on a
subsequenty run after FPM had scaled down to an idle state.

In addition to the cursor method we used above, which sets the [$maxTimeMS][]
meta operator on the query, most commands support a `maxTimeMS` option (support
for write commands is forthcoming in [SERVER-13622][]). If you're using
[`MongoDB::command()`][db-command], the `maxTimeMS` option goes directly on the
command document itself, instead of in the array you might have previously used
to specify `socketTimeoutMS`. Other command helper methods are documented
accordingly.

While this won't match the blazing performance of our DoS attack, it uses server
and driver resources much more responsibly. This is doubly important given the
PHP driver's lack of connection pooling. Our persistent connection model means
that the expected connection load for a single mongod comes down to:

```
web servers × worker pool size × mongod connections
```

Workers (i.e. driver instances) will typically require a single mongod
connection. Multiple connections could be required if different sets of auth
credentials are involved, but the number should still be predictable. But the
equation breaks down when workers can consume more than their fair share of
server resources, which is made all too easy with hasty socket timeouts. At
scale, that can lead to a domino effect of abandoned connections. That said,
[maxTimeMS][] is the Rick Astley of timeouts—at least as far as sockets are
concerned.

  [^2]: [$where][] should be used sparingly. It is best used in conjunction with
        other, selective query criteria, which can take advantage of an index
        and limit the number of JavaScript executions required. Including it in
        a collection scan (as we do here) is generally a bad idea unless you
        know what you're doing.
